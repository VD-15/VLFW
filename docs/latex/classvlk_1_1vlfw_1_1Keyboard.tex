\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Static keyboard class. 

Stores the states of keyboard keys. Keys that are pressed are guaranteed to have Is\+Key\+Pressed return true for exactly one frame, same with released keys and Is\+Key\+Released. Keys may be pressed and released on the same frame, but Is\+Key\+Down and Is\+Key\+Up will always accurately report the latest known state of the key. To use this class, one must first construct an instance of \mbox{\hyperlink{classvlk_1_1vlfw_1_1KeyboardMain}{Keyboard\+Main}}.

Gets the scancode of the given key. 

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{From GLFW\textquotesingle{}s Documentation}
The scancode is unique for every key, regardless of whether it has a key token. Scancodes are platform-\/specific but consistent over time, so keys will have different scancodes depending on the platform but they are safe to save to disk.
