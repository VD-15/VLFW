\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Static mouse class. 

Stores the states of mouse buttons, the position of the mouse and how far the mouse has scrolled. Buttons that are pressed are guaranteed to have Is\+Button\+Pressed return true for exactly one frame, same with released buttons and Is\+Button\+Released. Buttons may be pressed and released on the same frame, but Is\+Button\+Down and Is\+Button\+Up will always report the last known state of the button. To use this class, one must first construct an instance of \mbox{\hyperlink{classvlk_1_1vlfw_1_1MouseMain}{Mouse\+Main}}.

Gets the distance the mouse has moved since the last frame. 

The returned vector will be measured in screen units. If the mouse leaves the boundaries of the window, this figure will not be reported accurately.
