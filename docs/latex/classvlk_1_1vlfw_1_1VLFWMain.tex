\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Handles window-\/related events. 

\mbox{\hyperlink{classvlk_1_1vlfw_1_1VLFWMain}{VLFWMain}} handles the initialization of GLFW and event processing for any constructed window components. Only one instance of \mbox{\hyperlink{classvlk_1_1vlfw_1_1VLFWMain}{VLFWMain}} may be constructed at once and various parts of VLFW will not work without it, so you should construct one before doing anything else. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/\+VLFW/VLFW.\+hpp\item 
src/VLFW.\+cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
